We don't have any studies so far showing if a robot follows the similar strategy how customers would interpret the intent.

what robots/papers examine that? what does it mean to have a few examine sales-oriented communication? where is the source. 

Salem et al and including studies show politeness can be a great factor in human robot interaction by which a robot can influence the human perception and the acceptance of itself.

> > Positive reinforcement means praising people when they do something, which makes them want to do it again. In robot research, warmth and competence have been shown to increase trust [6]. For human servers, the evidence is clear: waiters who complimented customers (“You made an excellent choice”) got higher tips and better ratings [3], [7]. This kind of talk makes people feel good and improves how they see the service. But we don’t know if it works the same way when a robot does it.

this paragraph doesn't make quite a sense and it seems off

We define positive reinforcement as the act of praising people when they are have expressed their desire for something, in our case, any food from the restaurant. For human servers, who did that, usually got higher tips and better ratings, as we have seen from social and economics research from B. Rind et al and M. Lynn et al. [3,7]

> > Upselling means trying to get customers to buy more stuff or upgrades. With human servers, whether it works depends on how customers see it: if it feels helpful, they’re more likely to say yes, but if it feels pushy, they get annoyed.

give me a source for that

> > . Trust and Tipping Trust matters a lot for both satisfaction and whether people do what the robot suggests [6]. In restaurants, trust directly affects how customers see the service and whether they come back. Tipping gives us a real behavior we can measure. Research on human servers shows that friendliness and gratitude increase tips [4]. Related work on robotic bartenders found that only about 11% of participants said they would tip a robot, often reasoning that robots do not need income or appreciation; however, willingness to tip increased when participants learned that tips would benefit human staff or help the robot improve its service [10]. By measuring both tips and survey responses, this study looks at both the economic and psychological sides of robot-customer interaction. E. Summary Past research shows that expression of talk, warmth, and trust all matter for satisfaction with both human and robot service. But no study has directly compared positive reinforcement and upselling when a robot takes orders. Building on what we know about human servers, this study looks at how these two ways of talking affect both how customers feel and how much they tip.

both paragraph contradicts each other. what could be the better two paragraphs?
